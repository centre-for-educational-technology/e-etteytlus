Deployment:

1. Copy all files into a PHP directory
2. Configure "config.php"
3. Execute "deploy.php", if deployment fails, manually delete the created database (if any) before retry
4. After deployment, "deploy.php" cannot be used to attack the program, however it can be deleted if you like


Usage:

1. /user.html is used to access the test performer side
2. /conductor.html is used to access the conductor side
